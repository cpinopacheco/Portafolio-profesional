    "description-pokeapi-2": "To go further, I wanted to imitate the features of the original pokedex, to achieve this, add extra features such as an on and off button, sound effects, animations and error control to improve the experience.

I achieved that through interaction with the web API known as 'SpeechSynthesis'.",

    "description-digital-curriculum-2": "The phone number and email address at the top of the resume header are linked to provide direct contact.

When I observed a person drawing a raffle online and searched the internet for a random number generator, but many of these programs were very simple and not very stylish. So at that moment it occurred to me to create a different program, something that would not only meet the main needs of a raffle giveaway, but also that would be eye-catching and intuitive with the user.",
    "description-raffle-draw-2": "The program allows the user to enter the number of numbers that will participate in the raffle, in addition to the prizes that will be drawn. Rendering this information on screen so that all participants are aware of the information. It also allows you to obtain winning and losing numbers randomly, which are displayed in different sections of the application.
